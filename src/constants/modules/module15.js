  quizTitle: "Quiz: DB Valuation - Data Checks",

  quizQuestions: [
    {
      id: 1,
      section: "Funding Structure",
      question: "Which of the following correctly matches the Funding Structure of a pension scheme with its key feature?",
      options: [
        "A. Defined Contribution (DC) – Guarantees a specific benefit amount to members",
        "B. Defined Benefit (DB) – Employer and employee contribute fixed amounts; member bears investment risk",
        "C. Defined Contribution (DC) – Benefits equal contributions plus investment returns, net of expenses",
        "D. Defined Benefit (DB) – Member bears both investment and longevity risk"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "C. Defined Contribution (DC) – Benefits equal contributions plus investment returns, net of expenses",
      explanation: "In a DC scheme, the final benefit depends only on contributions made plus investment returns, net of expenses. DB schemes, by contrast, guarantee specific benefits."
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      section: "Investment Risk",
      question: "In a Defined Benefit (DB) scheme, who primarily bears the investment and longevity risk?",
      options: [
        "A. The member",
        "B. The trustees",
        "C. The employer/sponsor",
        "D. The Retirement Benefits Authority (RBA)"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "C. The employer/sponsor",
      explanation: "DB schemes promise a defined benefit regardless of market performance, so the employer carries both the investment and longevity risks."
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      section: "Hybrid Schemes",
      question: "Which of the following is NOT a recognized type of hybrid scheme design?",

        "A. Minimum Guarantee Plans",
        "B. Cash Balance Plans",
        "C. Combination Plans",
        "D. Indexed Salary Plans"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "D. Indexed Salary Plans",
      explanation: "Hybrid designs include Minimum Guarantee, Cash Balance, and Combination plans. 'Indexed Salary Plans' is not a hybrid type."
    },
    {
      id: 4,
      section: "Membership Register",
      question: "Which of the following is NOT typically included in the Membership Register for active members?",

        "B. Final Average Salary",
        "C. Accumulated Member Balance",
        "D. Annual Pension in Payment"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "D. Annual Pension in Payment",
      explanation: "The Membership Register tracks active members, so it captures salary and balances but not pension amounts, which apply only to pensioners."
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      section: "Withdrawals Register",
      question: "Why is the Withdrawals Register particularly relevant for Defined Contribution (DC) schemes?",
      options: [
        "A. It tracks employer funding levels",
        "B. It records actuarial assumptions",
        "C. It tracks access to individual accounts at retirement or exit",
        "D. It ensures guaranteed minimum pensions are paid"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "C. It tracks access to individual accounts at retirement or exit",
      explanation: "In DC schemes, members can withdraw from their accounts upon retirement or leaving employment, so the Withdrawals Register is crucial."
    },
    {
      id: 6,
      section: "DB Benefit Calculation",
      question: "In a DB scheme, how is the retirement benefit typically calculated?",
      options: [
        "A. Based on contributions plus interest",
        "B. As a fixed amount set by the employer",
        "C. Using a formula linked to salary and years of service",
        "D. Equal to one-third of pensionable salary"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "C. Using a formula linked to salary and years of service",
      explanation: "DB schemes use formulas (e.g., % of final salary × years of service) to determine retirement benefits."
    },
    {
      id: 7,
      section: "Investment Risk in DC",
      question: "In a DC scheme, who bears the investment risk?",

        "D. Survivor pensions automatically included"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "B. Simple actuarial valuations",
      explanation: "DC schemes are straightforward to administer because benefits equal account balances and don't require complex actuarial valuations."
    },
    {
      id: 9,
      section: "DC Disadvantages",
      question: "Which of the following is a disadvantage of a DC scheme?",

        "A. Costly for employers",
        "B. Benefits are less portable",
        "C. Retirement income is uncertain",
        "D. Requires complex actuarial reviews"

      correctAnswer: "C. Retirement income is uncertain",
      explanation: "In DC schemes, benefits depend on market returns and contribution levels, which makes retirement income uncertain."
    },
    {
      id: 10,
      section: "DB Disadvantages",
      question: "Which of the following is a disadvantage of a DB scheme?",

      question: "In a Pension Fund, what proportion of the member's fund can be taken as a cash lump sum at retirement?",

        "B. One-half",
        "C. Two-thirds",
        "D. Entire balance"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "A. One-third",
      explanation: "By law, a maximum of one-third can be taken as a lump sum, while the rest must be converted into an income stream."
    },
    {
      id: 12,
      section: "Guaranteed Fund",
      question: "Which of the following is a feature of a Guaranteed Fund?",
