      "This module aims to equip learners with practical skills in calculating and analyzing the Liability for Remaining Coverage (‘LRC’). By the end of the module, participants will be able to determine Unearned Premium Reserve (‘UPR’), calculate Earned Premium, apply Deferred Acquisition Costs (‘DAC’), and derive the LRC using real insurance data. This will strengthen the accuracy of actuarial valuations, improve the reliability of financial reporting, and support compliance with IFRS 17 requirements.",
